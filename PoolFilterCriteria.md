• $45,000+ TVL

• $800,000+ 24H Volume

• Volume - 20%+ 24hr Fee/TVL

I also recommend steering clear of pools with 900%+ 24hr Fee/TVL.

You can narrow the distribution range to 3-7 for a more concentrated spread.

I recommend opening a position with a 50/50 ratio.


Take the scenario I painted for CLMMs, in a DLMM, you could have:

9.2% at 99 USDC per SOL, 

5.5% at 99.5 USDC per SOL 

70.3% at 100 USDC per SOL

12% at 100.5 USDC per SOL

3% at 101 USDC per SOL

DLMMs place no restrictions on how to distribute your liquidity.

This allows you to capture more fees if you have a good inkling of how the market will behave.


Consider --- opening multiple spot spread distributions to manage the liquidity curve. or stack a few positions at different varying ranges to fit certain market bias.
