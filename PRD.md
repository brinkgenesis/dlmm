Product Requirements Document (PRD): Meteora DLMM Automated Liquidity Provider Bot
---
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for developing an Automated Liquidity Provider (LP) Operator Bot for Meteora's Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM). The bot is designed to automate the management of liquidity positions within tightly controlled price ranges, optimizing fee collection and reducing the need for constant monitoring. It targets traders who engage in liquidity provision, particularly in pairings like SOL - USDC and SOL - USDT, aiming to maximize efficiency and returns while mitigating impermanent loss (IL).
---
2. Objectives
Automate Liquidity Management: Automate the process of adding, removing, and adjusting liquidity positions based on predefined strategies and real-time market conditions.
Maximize Fee Collection: Capture trading fees by maintaining liquidity positions within optimal price ranges during favorable market conditions.
Mitigate Impermanent Loss: Reduce exposure to IL by dynamically adjusting positions when market volatility exceeds predefined thresholds.
Real-time Monitoring and Adjustment: Continuously monitor liquidity pools and automatically adjust positions to stay within specified price ranges.
Provide Real-time Analytics: Offer insights on position performance, including fees earned, price movements, and range efficiency to aid strategic decision-making.
---
3. Scope
Development: Implement a TypeScript-based bot to be hosted on AWS infrastructure.
Strategy Implementation: Incorporate strategies for dynamic liquidity management in Meteora DLMM pools, including automatic position adjustment when price ranges are breached.
Integration: Utilize Meteora's DLMM SDK and APIs for executing liquidity operations and interacting with DLMM pools.
Monitoring: Implement real-time market monitoring to adjust liquidity positions based on price movements and volatility.
User Configuration: Enable users to configure position parameters such as size, price ranges, and strategies through a user-friendly interface or configuration files.
Reporting and Alerts: Provide real-time analytics, performance reports, and notifications for key events like position adjustments and range exits.
---
4. Assumptions
The bot will be developed using TypeScript.
The application will be hosted on AWS infrastructure.
Meteora's DLMM SDK and APIs are accessible and provide necessary functionalities.
Users have permission to execute transactions on behalf of their accounts.
The bot will manage medium-sized positions (e.g., $50,000 to $100,000).
Price ranges for positions are typically within -3% to +3% of the current market price.

5. Functional Requirements
5.1. Liquidity Management
Add Liquidity: ‚úÖ Implemented via `marketSelector.ts`.
Remove Liquidity: ‚úÖ Implemented as part of rebalancing (`rebalanceManager.ts`), risk management (`riskManager.ts`), and potentially orders (`orderManager.ts`).
Automatic Position Adjustment: ‚úÖ Implemented in `rebalanceManager.ts` based on price range breach. Closes old and creates new single-sided position.
Take Profit & Stop Loss: ‚úÖ Implemented in `positionTriggerMonitor.ts` and `marketSelector.ts` to set and monitor TP/SL for positions.
Configurable Position Parameters: ‚úÖ Position size (via dollar amount), side, take profit, and stop loss are selectable via API. Range is dynamically set around the active bin.
5.2. Market Monitoring
Real-time Monitoring: ‚úÖ `rebalanceManager.ts` checks active bin relative to position range periodically.
Take Profit/Stop Loss Monitoring: ‚úÖ `positionTriggerMonitor.ts` checks positions against price triggers periodically.
Volatility Detection: üõ† Basic volume drop detection in `riskManager.ts`. Advanced volatility analysis (e.g., Volatility Accumulator) not implemented.
Price Range Tracking: ‚úÖ Core logic in `rebalanceManager.ts`.
5.3. Strategy Implementation
Spot Strategy: üõ† Not explicitly implemented as a primary strategy; rebalancing uses single-sided.
Curve Strategy: ‚ùå Not Implemented.
Bid-Ask Strategy: ‚úÖ `BidAskImBalanced` used for single-sided creation/rebalancing.
Dynamic Fee Optimization: ‚ùå Not Implemented (uses pool's base fee).
5.4. Notifications and Alerts
Automated Alerts: ‚ùå Not Implemented (Requires `alerting_system.ts`).
Error Handling: ‚úÖ Basic logging implemented throughout. Formal alerting missing.
Performance Summaries: ‚úÖ Provided via `/api/positions` endpoint (`dashboard.ts`).
5.5. Reporting
Performance Metrics: ‚úÖ Basic PnL, current value, fees (pending/claimed via Meteora API) available via `dashboard.ts`.
Real-time Analytics: ‚úÖ Dashboard provides real-time enriched data.
Historical Data: ‚úÖ Stored in Supabase DB via `positionRepository.ts` and `marketRepository.ts`.
Impermanent Loss Calculation: ‚ùå Not Implemented.

Other items: IL calculation - Not Implemented.

Ex: If we expect both pools to have a delta of 20% within X time period, we need to calculate the amount of IL incured and measure it aganist the potential fees (via volume and volitality) and net expected outcomes in %. We also need to factor in negative market movements. Ex if token A Sol goes down 10%, and memecoin goes down 30% in same time frame. We will take .78% impemenant loss and roughly -20% from the token dropping. If tokens range that is the ideal condition. If the market goes up, we will get more of the base token as a profit taking practice. We can also weight this vs market conditions to come up with EV of three scenarios: market goes up, market ranges, market goes down. The former two are ideal situations, with the latter being non-ideal.

7. User Stories
7.1. Liquidity Provider
As a liquidity provider, I want the bot to automatically manage my DLMM positions within my specified price range and position size so that I can maximize fees and minimize IL without manual intervention.
7.2. Risk Manager
As a risk manager, I want to set volatility thresholds and price ranges so that the bot withdraws liquidity during high-risk periods and re-enters when conditions are favorable.
7.3. Analyst
As an analyst, I want to review real-time analytics and performance reports to assess the effectiveness of different strategies and make informed decisions about adjustments.

17. Additional Notes
The bot aims to revolutionize liquidity provision on Meteora by automating critical aspects of LP operation, enhancing profitability, and reducing manual efforts.
Given the complexities of DeFi and automated trading, it's crucial to conduct thorough testing and have robust monitoring in place to handle market fluctuations and technical anomalies.
Collaboration with Meteora's support team is recommended to ensure compliance with best practices and to stay updated on any changes in APIs or SDKs.
