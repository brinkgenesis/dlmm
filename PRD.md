Product Requirements Document (PRD): Meteora DLMM Automated Liquidity Provider Bot
---
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for developing an Automated Liquidity Provider (LP) Operator Bot for Meteora's Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM). The bot is designed to automate the management of liquidity positions within tightly controlled price ranges, optimizing fee collection and reducing the need for constant monitoring. It targets traders who engage in liquidity provision, particularly in pairings like SOL - USDC and SOL - USDT, aiming to maximize efficiency and returns while mitigating impermanent loss (IL).
---
2. Objectives
Automate Liquidity Management: Automate the process of adding, removing, and adjusting liquidity positions based on predefined strategies and real-time market conditions.
Maximize Fee Collection: Capture trading fees by maintaining liquidity positions within optimal price ranges during favorable market conditions.
Mitigate Impermanent Loss: Reduce exposure to IL by dynamically adjusting positions when market volatility exceeds predefined thresholds.
Real-time Monitoring and Adjustment: Continuously monitor liquidity pools and automatically adjust positions to stay within specified price ranges.
Provide Real-time Analytics: Offer insights on position performance, including fees earned, price movements, and range efficiency to aid strategic decision-making.
---
3. Scope
Development: Implement a TypeScript-based bot to be hosted on AWS infrastructure.
Strategy Implementation: Incorporate strategies for dynamic liquidity management in Meteora DLMM pools, including automatic position adjustment when price ranges are breached.
Integration: Utilize Meteora's DLMM SDK and APIs for executing liquidity operations and interacting with DLMM pools.
Monitoring: Implement real-time market monitoring to adjust liquidity positions based on price movements and volatility.
User Configuration: Enable users to configure position parameters such as size, price ranges, and strategies through a user-friendly interface or configuration files.
Reporting and Alerts: Provide real-time analytics, performance reports, and notifications for key events like position adjustments and range exits.
---
4. Assumptions
The bot will be developed using TypeScript.
The application will be hosted on AWS infrastructure.
Meteora's DLMM SDK and APIs are accessible and provide necessary functionalities.
Users have permission to execute transactions on behalf of their accounts.
The bot will manage medium-sized positions (e.g., $50,000 to $100,000).
Price ranges for positions are typically within -3% to +3% of the current market price.
---
5. Functional Requirements
5.1. Liquidity Management
Add Liquidity: Allocate assets to DLMM pools based on selected strategies when market conditions are favorable and within the specified price range.
Remove Liquidity: Withdraw assets from DLMM pools when the market price moves outside the predefined price range or when volatility exceeds thresholds.
Automatic Position Adjustment: Close existing positions and open new ones adjusted to the current market price when the price moves out of the specified range.
Configurable Position Parameters: Allow users to set the size of the position and desired price range for operation.
5.2. Market Monitoring
Real-time Monitoring: Constantly monitor selected liquidity pools to ensure positions remain within pre-set price ranges.
Volatility Detection: Monitor price volatility of token pairs in real-time and adjust positions based on volatility thresholds.
Price Range Tracking: Keep track of the current price relative to the user-defined price bands.
5.3. Strategy Implementation
Spot Strategy: Provide uniform liquidity distribution suitable for stable market conditions.
Curve Strategy: Concentrate liquidity around the current price to maximize capital efficiency.
Bid-Ask Strategy: Allocate liquidity at both ends of the price range to capture volatility swings.
Dynamic Fee Optimization: Leverage Meteora's dynamic fees to maximize earnings by providing liquidity during high-fee periods within acceptable volatility thresholds.
5.4. Notifications and Alerts
Automated Alerts: Send notifications regarding liquidity position changes, range breaches, and position adjustments.
Error Handling: Alert on failed transactions or system errors to allow prompt intervention.
Performance Summaries: Provide periodic summaries of position performance and earnings.
5.5. Reporting
Performance Metrics: Generate reports on fees collected, IL avoided, and overall performance of the liquidity positions.
Real-time Analytics: Provide insights on position performance, including fees earned, price movements, and range efficiency.
Historical Data: Store transaction history and position adjustments for analysis and auditing purposes.

Other items: Needs to calculate potential IL of positions and simulate them for the pool before determining that it is a good opportunity. 

Ex: If we expect both pools to have a delta of 20% within X time period, we need to calculate the amount of IL incured and measure it aganist the potential fees (via volume and volitality) and net expected outcomes in %. We also need to factor in negative market movements. Ex if token A Sol goes down 10%, and memecoin goes down 30% in same time frame. We will take .78% impemenant loss and roughly -20% from the token dropping. If tokens range that is the ideal condition. If the market goes up, we will get more of the base token as a profit taking practice. We can also weight this vs market conditions to come up with EV of three scenarios: market goes up, market ranges, market goes down. The former two are ideal situations, with the latter being non-ideal.
