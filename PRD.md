Product Requirements Document (PRD): Meteora DLMM Liquidity Management Bot
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for developing a bot that manages liquidity positions in Meteora's Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) pools. The bot aims to maximize fee collection from trading volume while mitigating impermanent loss (IL) by dynamically adjusting liquidity positions based on market volatility.
2. Objectives
Maximize Fee Collection: Capture trading fees by providing liquidity during periods of stable market conditions.
Mitigate Impermanent Loss: Reduce exposure to IL by withdrawing liquidity during high volatility periods when the price might move beyond the desired range.
Automate Liquidity Management: Automate the process of adding and removing liquidity based on predefined strategies and market conditions.
Integrate with Meteora DLMM: Utilize Meteora's DLMM SDK and APIs for seamless interaction with the DLMM pools.
3. Scope
Develop a Typescript-based bot hosted on AWS.
Implement strategies for dynamic liquidity management in Meteora DLMM pools.
Integrate with Meteora's DLMM SDK and APIs for executing liquidity operations.
Monitor market volatility and adjust liquidity positions accordingly.
4. Assumptions
The bot will be developed using Typescript.
The application will be hosted on AWS infrastructure.
Meteora's DLMM SDK and APIs are accessible and provide necessary functionalities.
The bot has permission to execute transactions on behalf of the user.
5. Functional Requirements
5.1. Liquidity Management
Add Liquidity: Allocate assets to DLMM pools based on selected strategies when market conditions are favorable.
Remove Liquidity: Withdraw assets from DLMM pools when market volatility exceeds predefined thresholds.
5.2. Market Monitoring
Volatility Detection: Monitor price volatility of token pairs in real-time.
Price Range Tracking: Keep track of the current price relative to the predefined price bands.
5.3. Strategy Implementation
Spot Strategy: Provide uniform liquidity distribution suitable for stable market conditions.
Curve Strategy: Concentrate liquidity around the current price to maximize capital efficiency.
Bid-Ask Strategy: Allocate liquidity at both ends of the price range to capture volatility swings.
5.4. Notifications and Alerts
Status Updates: Send notifications regarding liquidity position changes.
Error Handling: Alert on failed transactions or system errors.
5.5. Reporting
Performance Metrics: Provide reports on fees collected, IL avoided, and overall performance.
Historical Data: Store transaction history for analysis.
6. Non-Functional Requirements
6.1. Security
Authentication: Secure access to wallets and private keys.
Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
Compliance: Adhere to relevant financial regulations and best practices.
6.2. Scalability
Modular Design: Architect the bot to allow future strategy additions.
Load Handling: Ensure the system can handle high-frequency data updates without performance degradation.
6.3. Reliability
Error Recovery: Implement mechanisms for retrying failed transactions.
Uptime: Aim for high availability with minimal downtime.
6.4. Performance
Low Latency: Optimize for quick response times to market changes.
Efficient Resource Use: Optimize AWS resource usage to reduce costs.
7. User Stories
7.1. Liquidity Provider
As a liquidity provider, I want the bot to manage my DLMM positions automatically so that I can maximize fees and minimize IL without manual intervention.
7.2. Risk Manager
As a risk manager, I want to set volatility thresholds so that the bot withdraws liquidity during high-risk periods.
7.3. Analyst
As an analyst, I want to review performance reports to assess the effectiveness of different strategies.
8. Technical Requirements
8.1. Architecture
Frontend: A lightweight dashboard (optional) for monitoring (built with React or similar).
Backend: A serverless application using AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.
Database: AWS DynamoDB or RDS for storing configuration and transaction history.
Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch for logs and alerts.
8.2. Integrations
Meteora DLMM SDK: Utilize the @meteora-ag/dlmm NPM package.
Meteora APIs: Interact with endpoints provided by Meteora DLMM API.
Wallet Integration: Securely interact with wallets for signing transactions.
8.3. Strategies Implementation
8.3.1. Volatility Monitoring
Implement algorithms to calculate real-time volatility using the Volatility Accumulator as described in Dynamic Fees.
8.3.2. Liquidity Adjustment Logic
Define thresholds for volatility that trigger liquidity withdrawal and re-entry.
Use predefined strategies (Spot, Curve, Bid-Ask) as templates for liquidity distribution.
8.4. Security
Use AWS Secrets Manager for handling API keys and wallet credentials.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if a dashboard is provided.
8.5. Testing
Unit tests for all critical components using Jest or a similar framework.
Integration tests for interactions with Meteora DLMM.
Simulate different market conditions to test strategy effectiveness.
9. Deployment
Utilize AWS CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
Deploy backend services as Docker containers if necessary.
10. Monitoring and Maintenance
Set up AWS CloudWatch dashboards for monitoring system performance.
Implement logging and alerting for transaction failures and exceptions.
Schedule regular reviews of strategy performance and system health.
11. Risks and Mitigations
Market Risk: Sudden market changes not captured promptly.
Mitigation: Optimize for low-latency data processing and adjust volatility thresholds as needed.
Security Risk: Potential compromise of wallet keys.
Mitigation: Use secure key management solutions and enforce strict access controls.
Technical Risk: API changes from Meteora DLMM.
Mitigation: Monitor for updates in Meteora's SDK and APIs; design system to handle exceptions gracefully.
12. Strategy Suggestions
Based on the provided documentation, the following strategy implementations are recommended:
12.1. Dynamic Fee Optimization
Monitor Dynamic Fees: Leverage Meteora's Dynamic Fees to identify periods when fees are higher due to increased volatility.
Fee Maximization: Provide liquidity during high-fee periods within acceptable volatility thresholds to maximize earnings.
12.2. Advanced Strategies
Ranged Limit Orders: Implement logic to place liquidity at specific price ranges anticipating future price movements.
DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) While Earning: Utilize the Bid-Ask strategy to gradually accumulate or offload positions while earning fees.
Volatility Capture: Use the Volatility Accumulator to determine optimal times to enter or exit liquidity positions.
12.3. Farming Rewards
Maximize Rewards: Participate in DLMM farming as described in DLMM Farming Rewards by ensuring liquidity is provided in the active bin.
Reward Claiming: Automate the claiming of farming rewards and swap fees to compound earnings.
13. API and SDK Usage
SDK Functions:
initializePositionAndAddLiquidityByStrategy: For adding liquidity positions based on selected strategies.
removeLiquidity: For withdrawing liquidity when volatility thresholds are met.
getDynamicFee: To fetch current dynamic fee rates and adjust strategies accordingly.
API Endpoints:
Utilize endpoints from Meteora DLMM API for real-time data and transaction execution.
14. Deliverables
Source code repository containing the bot's codebase.
Deployment scripts or configurations for AWS services.
Documentation for setup, configuration, and operation.
Test cases and results.
Performance reports and analytics dashboards (if applicable).
15. Timeline
A proposed timeline for development can be structured as follows:
Week 1-2: Requirement analysis and architectural design.
Week 3-5: Development of core functionalities (liquidity management, market monitoring).
Week 6: Integration with Meteora SDK and APIs.
Week 7: Testing and optimization.
Week 8: Deployment on AWS and final reviews.
